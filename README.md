# Micronaut Framework [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat.svg)](https://awesome.re)

## :clipboard: Introduction

[Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) is a JVM-based framework for building lightweight, modular applications. Developed by OCI, the same company that created Grails, Micronaut is the latest framework designed to make creating microservices quick and easy.

While Micronaut contains some features that are similar to existing frameworks like Spring, it also has some new features that set it apart. And with support for Java, Groovy, and Kotlin, it offers a variety of ways to create applications.

## :cloud: Getting Started

Follow along this notes. You will need to have at least [Java 1](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) installed or some openJDK distribution, and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) on the PATH.
